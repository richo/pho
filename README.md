Slash and Golang. Always a good decision.

### Hacking

Take careful note of where you branch if you hack on this repo. It will undergo and epic rebase at some point.

### Build you some slash

```
CC=clang ./configure --debug --no-ext=json --no-ext=markdown --no-ext=mysql --no-ext=curl --no-ext=gcrypt --prefix ~/.slash/versions/trunk
```

#### What people are saying:

```
btw you may be the first person to ever run multiple slash vms at the same time :p
